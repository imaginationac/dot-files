# Dot-files

This is my personal collection of dot files for various programs (e.g. Vim).  I
release them under the public domain. If your jurisdiction does not recognize
the concept of public domain, choose the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Suggestions

- Keep all your dot files in the repo.
- Sym-link to the files you need to use.
- If you're on Windows, weep. Then manually copy the files to where the need to
go (and/or rename them appropriately i.e. \_vimrc)
	- Exception: On Windows 7 (possibly Vista) or later, you can create symbolic
	links from the command line. You'll have to be an administrator, and the
	shell must be "Run as Administrator".
- Alternative: Keep all your dot files in the repo, and use the appropriate
include functionality.
