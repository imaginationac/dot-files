# Dot-files

This is my personal collection of dotfiles for various programs (e.g. Vim). 
I release them under the public domain. If your jurisdiction does not recognize
the concept of public domain, choose the MIT License.

## Suggestions

- Keep all your dot files in the repo.
- Sym-link to the files you need to use.
- If you're on Windows, weep. Then manually copy the files to where the need to go (and/or rename them appropriately i.e. \_vimrc)
- Alternative: Keep all you dot files in the repo, and use the appropriate include functionality.
